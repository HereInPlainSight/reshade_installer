##
# If, for example, there was a default repository whose shaders cause issues, you could blacklist them.
# Default repositories are scraped from reshade itself from the following file:
# https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crosire/reshade-shaders/list/EffectPackages.ini
# If a repository is included somewhere in the `include.d` shaders files AND the `blacklist.d`, the blacklist will win.

# Example format:
# If you wanted to disable OtisFX's repo, you could do so by uncommenting the following line:
#https://github.com/FransBouma/OtisFX
